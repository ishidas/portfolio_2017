    <p>Passionate and goal-oriented Full-Stack Software Developer with background in marketing. Having strong interpersonal skills, capable of ramping up quickly to new tools and technologies.</p>
    <p>My passion in life is coding, cooking and traveling. In 2015, I decided to move from Hawaii to Seattle with the idea in mind that I would go back to school for programming. That was the best decision I had ever made! A year later, I am a programmer, and I am capable of solving problems for others, possibly contributing my skills and time to people who need help. I love the creativity side of programming as well. When I have an idea to create a logo or a web app, I can do so in no time!</p>
